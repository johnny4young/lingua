/**
 * RL-079 — Minimal env builder for native runner subprocesses.
 *
 * Before this lived, the Go and Rust runners spread `process.env`
 * directly into `execFile`/`spawn`, which leaked every secret the
 * Electron main process happens to inherit (CI tokens, OPENAI_API_KEY,
 * etc.) into the spawned toolchain. The builder picks ONLY the keys
 * a toolchain actually needs from the host env, then layers the
 * user-tier env from RL-011 on top, then applies runner-owned
 * overrides (e.g. `GOOS=js` / `GOARCH=wasm` for Go) last so user env
 * cannot shadow them.
 *
 * The toolchain-key allowlists are intentionally tight in v1 — if a
 * smoke run on a real host fails because we omitted a key the
 * toolchain needs, add it here explicitly with a comment naming the
 * smoke. Widening on guesswork defeats the leakage defense.
 */

/**
 * Common host-env keys both toolchains need. Lean on purpose:
 *  - PATH lets the toolchain find its own binaries (linker, etc.).
 *  - HOME anchors the per-user toolchain caches (.cargo, .cache/go-build).
 *  - LANG ensures rustc emits UTF-8 diagnostics on locales like POSIX.
 *  - TMPDIR keeps mkdtemp colocated with the user's preferred tmp root.
 *
 * Windows essentials are listed separately and only added when the
 * platform check matches; on POSIX they would all be undefined and
 * dropped by the resolver anyway, but listing them for the wrong
 * platform makes the array harder to audit.

 *
 *   1. Pick `toolchainKeys` from `process.env`. Missing keys are
 *      silently dropped — we never emit a key with `undefined`
 *      because Node's `child_process` stringifies that to the literal
 *      `"undefined"` on some platforms, which would silently shadow
 *      a real value the spawned binary might pick up from elsewhere.
 *   2. Merge the RL-011 user env tier on top. Non-string values are
 *      dropped defensively (the renderer's envVarsStore validates
 *      them, but the IPC boundary is untrusted).
 *   3. Apply runner-owned `overrides` last so they always win
 *      (e.g. `GOOS=js` / `GOARCH=wasm`).
 *
 * Tests in `tests/main/nativeEnv.test.ts` pin every layer.
